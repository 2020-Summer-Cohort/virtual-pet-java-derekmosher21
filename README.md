# Virtual Pet README

Hello! Welcome to the Virtual Pet Application! In this game, you wll be taking
care of Martin the Cat. To win the game, you must make Martin very happy. 
To achieve this, you must bring his happiness level to 20 or more.

This is a turn based game. During every turn, you will have a number of options
to interact with Martin. You must keep him healthy and satisfied or he will run
away! Use your number keys to input to the terminal.

You need to be aware of Martin's attributes during the game. Do not let his 
hunger or thirst reach level 20 or above, and do not allow his happiness or 
energy to dip to 0 or below. Martin will run away if any of these things 
happen! The only way to win the game is to bring Martin's happiness level to
20 or more. Good luck!
